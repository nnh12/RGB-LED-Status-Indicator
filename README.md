# LED-Status-Indicator_Module
This is the schematic/ PCB Layout design for RGB LED Status Indicator for the NASA Robot Mining Competition team. It is powered from a 24V system and uses a CAN transciever to listen for commands from a microcontroller. The microcontroller then controlls the LED driver which will then indicate the desired color. Worked with hardware team lead to design this project.
